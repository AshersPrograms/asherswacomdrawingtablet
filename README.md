A Linux Desktop interface with Wacom's Drawing Tablets

This program Depend on a Wacom Drawing Tablet 
This is the one that I bought: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XW9WW98?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1

This program has 2 things:
libqt5widgets5 and
xsetwacom

I used all the variable that were possible from xsetwacom and my drawing tablet and created a Desktop Application.

I designed this is MX Linux, with QT 5, ChatGPC(for text filtering) and from https://gist.github.com/technoburst/5369746
